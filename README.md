# Ubuntu_scripts

## note to self:
1. need script to install git, then prompt user to create Access password, login, then to clone ubuntu_script repo
2. ... install snap apps
3. ... install docker
4. ... login to email accounts (research)
5. ... disable screensaver, set background to black, and theme to darkmode
6. ... login to firefox and sync
7. ... figures out what flavour of linux it's run on, then asks if you want:
   - network information (using numerical menu)
   - Users (add remove (moving home dir somewhere))
   - hmmm.....
